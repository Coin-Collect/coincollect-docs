# ⚡ NFT Powers

### **⚡ NFT Power:  Higher power means higher earnings when staked.**

## Understanding NFT Power in Our Staking System

In the world of NFTs and decentralized finance, understanding the intricacies of how your digital assets can work for you is crucial. One of the key concepts in our staking system is the power of your NFTs, symbolized by the lightning icon (⚡). Let’s dive deeper into what this means and how it can benefit you.

## **What is NFT Power?**

NFT Power, denoted by the red ⚡ icon, is a measure of the earning potential of your NFT when you stake it in our platform. Think of it as a way to gauge the strength and productivity of your digital asset. The higher the power, the greater the rewards you can earn.

## **How Does NFT Power Work?**

When you stake your NFT, its power determines the amount of rewards you will receive. You can also stake more than one NFT in each pool, meaning the total power is the sum of the powers of all staked NFTs. For example, if you stake three NFTs with powers of 5, 10, and 15, your total earning power will be 30.
