## What is QuestGalaxy?

QuestGalaxy is a Web3 game studio creating blockchain-based gaming experiences that focus on:

- True asset ownership through NFTs and tokens
- Community-first design and participation
- Gameplay that stands on its own (not just token incentives)

### Why Web3 Gaming Matters

Traditional gaming locks achievements and rewards inside closed platforms. With Web3, players gain real ownership—unlocking NFTs, tradable tokens, and decentralized governance. In CoinCollect Games, your progress turns into real assets and new opportunities.

### CoinCollect: The Rewards Engine

- Stake NFTs in pools to earn tokens
- Claim rewards via your dashboard
- Track assets across multiple chains

### QuestGalaxy: Building Fun + Growth

QuestGalaxy (https://questgalaxy.com) builds Web3-native games with quests, leaderboards, competitions, and NFT-gated challenges, with a strong focus on community participation and gameplay quality.

### The Partnership: Games Powered by Rewards

- **NFT-gated games:** KEY NFTs and partner NFTs unlock access
- **Play-to-earn:** Earn $COLLECT, QuestGalaxy tokens, and special NFTs
- **Milestone achievements:** Progress generates collectible, tradable checkpoints
- **Seasonal events:** Leaderboards, exclusive loot, and bigger rewards

### What's In It For Players?

- Immersive gameplay and exclusive NFT access
- Earn $COLLECT, QuestGalaxy tokens, and limited-edition NFTs
- Special access using KEY NFTs and partner NFTs
- Connected multi-chain economy

## Featured game: GhostAlien

GhostAlien is QuestGalaxy’s invite-only space shooter built on Polygon, designed around sustainable Play-to-Earn tokenomics and NFT-gated gameplay.
