# Stake NFTs: Community Collections

Stake NFT collections you already own and earn rewards in CoinCollect Community Collections. These pools are designed so you can **stake NFTs** from popular Web3 communities (for example: **stake a Uniswap NFT** or **stake a Lens Profile NFT**) and receive token rewards when the pool is active.

We're thrilled to introduce Community Collections on CoinCollect, our special pools designed for the most valuable communities in the web3 ecosystem. Featuring projects like UniSwap, Lens Protocol, Unstoppable Domains, SushiSwap, SandBox, Crypto Unicorns, Smart Cats, and many more, these pools are a tribute to our vibrant community.
