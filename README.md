{% hint style="info" %}
CoinCollect is a decentralized NFT finance protocol operating on multi-chains that helps NFT traders, high-yield farmers, liquidity providers, developers, and Web3 startups to participate in an open financial market with no barriers to entry.
{% endhint %}

CoinCollect is a decentralized protocol that operates on multiple blockchain networks. It is designed to assist individuals and organizations involved in the non-fungible token (NFT) market, including traders, farmers, liquidity providers, developers, and Web3 startups. The protocol aims to create an open financial market that is accessible to everyone, with no barriers to entry.

The protocol allows NFT traders to buy and sell NFTs on a decentralized marketplace, which is supported by multiple blockchain networks. This allows for greater flexibility and access to a wider range of NFTs.

High yield farmers can also participate in the CoinCollect protocol by providing liquidity to the marketplace. This allows them to earn a return on their investment by providing liquidity to the market, which helps to increase the overall trading volume.

Developers and Web3 startups can use CoinCollect's open-source code to build their own decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the protocol. This allows them to create new and innovative ways to use NFTs in various industries and applications.

Overall, CoinCollect aims to create a decentralized and open financial market for NFTs, where anyone can participate and benefit from the growth of this burgeoning market.
